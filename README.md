In this personal protfilio I will admit I got stumpped quite a bit. I am not great at CSS haha. 
This isnt the prettiest but I know I can build onto and edit this when I get much better down the line. 
I started off with Creating the repo and dir to link them. 
I then went into vs code and put in just some starter html and starter css that I found on https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-starter-template-a-basic-html5-boilerplate-for-index-html/ which gave me the bare bones. I then went to https://codepen.io/mutedblues/pen/awdOjj for my starter css code. 
I then started crafting my html when I got stuck I went to https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_layout.asp but html isnt to hard. 
For my css styling again w3 schools was my savior. Again its not very detailed. 
For my logo I choose a fish that I found on google (I will site that below in a sourses section.) I choose that because all my buddies call me Fish. 
I got myself in there with one of my pictures. 
For my work I havent done much yet so I added a screenshot of my work on Horiseon. When you click the screen shot it directs you to the source of the image which I linked to my work in github. 
I added the about me and I didnt want to use filler latin so I added some things about me in the body of the html. 
I added a contact me section down in the footer and added some margins and layout boxes for people to type in. 
I tried my best but like I stated I am not the best at css. 
One thing I did learn is the use of rem as a size. I googled and asked what most web devolpers use for their size metrics and most said rem. 
Thanks for taking a look!
